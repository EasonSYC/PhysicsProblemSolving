# Physics Problem Solving

This is a compilation of question, notes and presentations for Physics Problem Solving Society happening at my school.

Many thanks to my friends, Lev and Dara for running this with me, and our teacher, Mr Swartzentruber for supporing and supervising the society.

Also, great thanks to everyone attending this society. It is a great pleasure to have you all here.
